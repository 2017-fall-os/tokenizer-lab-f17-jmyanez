os-tokenizer-lab


Objective

In this lab we demostrated our C programming Skills to create a tokenizer that would recieve and string and a delimiter and would divide the strings into tokens



To run this program go to tokenizer directory, Type make  to compile and create files and to run ./test, finally make clean to clean repository.


Collaborations 
During this lab i worked with: Danner Pacheco, to come up with a way to copy the strings into the vector, Ana Garcia helped me to understand how the copying of the tokens  should work and Sebastian Perez i helped him  with very minor debbuging stuff.
